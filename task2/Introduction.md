# Introduction to Maltego

- Maltego is  an open-source intelligence (OSINT) and graphical link analysis too tool used for gathering and analyzing information from the internet.
- It helps find connections between different things like websites, emails, IP addresses, social media profiles, and more.
-  By visualizing these connections in a graph, it makes it easier to see hidden relationships, which is useful for tasks like cybersecurity investigations, fraud detection, and penetration testing.

 ##  How Maltego Works:
- Start by dragging and dropping a domain (or email, IP address, etc.) into Maltegoâ€™s workspace.
-  After placing the domain, run "transforms" to gather related information. This could include DNS records, WHOIS data, email addresses, Ip address, location and more.
-  Maltego will create a graph showing all the related entities and how they are connected.
-  You can keep running more transforms on the new entities to explore deeper connections.
