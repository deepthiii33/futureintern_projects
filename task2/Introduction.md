# Introduction to Maltego

- Maltego is  an open-source intelligence (OSINT) and graphical link analysis  tool used for gathering and analyzing information from the internet.
- It helps find connections between different things like websites, emails, IP addresses, social media profiles, and more.
-  By visualizing these connections in a graph, it makes it easier to see hidden relationships, which is useful for tasks like cybersecurity investigations, fraud detection, and penetration testing.

-------
 
 ##  How Maltego Works:
- Start by dragging and dropping a domain (or email, IP address, etc.) into Maltego’s workspace.

-  After placing the domain, run "transforms" to gather related information. This could include DNS records, WHOIS data, email addresses, IP address, location and more.

-  Maltego will create a graph showing all the related entities and how they are connected.
-  You can continue running transforms on new entities to uncover more relationships

 - Once the graph is complete, we can export it

 This image shows the export and report generation options available in Maltego. The top menu includes features such as:
- Generate Report – Create a detailed report of the analysis.
- Export Graph to Table – Convert the graph into a structured table format.
- Export Graph as Image – Save the visualized graph as a PNG or other image formats.
- Export Graph as XML – Save the graph data in XML format for further processing.
