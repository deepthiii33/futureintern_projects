**Our traget site:** http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php 
**Our Goal:** To find the username and password of the target site. *(Here, the site already has a default username and password set as "test", but we will use Burp Suite to discover the credentials as if we donâ€™t know them.)*

## Steps

* Set Up FoxyProxy (for easy switching):
    * Install FoxyProxy in your browser -> Configure it to use Burp's Proxy (127.0.0.1:8080) -> Enable FoxyProxy to route traffic through Burp.
* Open Burp Suite and ensure Intercept is ON (Proxy â†’ Intercept)
* Go to the target site and enter any username and password on the login page
* Burp captures the request before it reaches the server
* Analyze the request in Burpâ€™s HTTP history (Proxy â†’ HTTP history), Look for the username and password fields in the request
* then sent to intruder
